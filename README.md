YourMapper iPhone App
=====================

Full Xcode of working YourMapper iPhone app that puts all our local data at your fingertips.  The free YourMapper app is open sourced on Github.  Since we pull in civic open data and make it available for free on our site, and through the app, we thought we'd open the app up to you for improvements.

About the App
-------------

**Use this repo as a starting point to see how to easily integrate our local data into your iOS apps with our API.** 

Please fork the code and improve it, add features, fix bugs, and release your own app.  It can be exactly like our app (minus our YourMapper branding), or it can be something totally different.  It's up to you.

Data API Key
------------

Visit our site for your own API key, to be placed in the mainapp/Supporting Files/defaults.plist YourMapperAPIKey field. If you are making API calls to YourMapper's API,
*the app won't work without your personal YourMapper API key!*
